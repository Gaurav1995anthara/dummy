SLES15 Sp3 x64 OS:
CM1 : 15.218.116.208
user01 ==> data*pr01
user02 ==> data*pr02
DP 23.4 build is available at location:  /DPdepot/23.4
 
 
# ---------------------------------------------- #
 
Rhel 8.1 x64 OS: (Note: DP is installed on another disk "/dpinstallDisk" for each DP locations)
CM1 : 15.218.116.96
user01 ==> data*pr01
user02 ==> data*pr02
DP 23.4 build is available at location:  /DPdepot/DP23.4
 
# ---------------------------------------------- #
 
upgrade three scenarios:
OS = SLES and RHEL (centOs)
Note: don't use root use sudo user01 (base version) and user02 (upgrade)
three releases needs to be tested:
11.01 ---> 25.1
23.4 MR --> 25.1
24.4 MR --> 25.1

steps:
23.3 CM (check DP java version 17.x) + add custom own java and check the version
install DP CM and upgrade --> issue reported as ==> upgrade is reporting some error and proceedings.
Check the upgrade DP logs for << dpidb.log function call >> function call details Anvith will share.

dedupe backup and restore (CM and client)
SQL (CM and node)
Cluster (CM and node)
Oracle



upgrade from 24.4 (enable GMSA) to 25.1 

gMSA:

1) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create FileSystem backup (backup should be successful) and perform restore (Restore should be successful)
2) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create FileSystem backup (backup should be successful), now again reset password (It will not ask for password) and perform restore (Restore should be successful)
3) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create storeones backup (backup should be successful) and perform restore (Restore should be successful)
4) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create storeones backup (backup should be successful) and in client user also Perform password authentication, perform restore (Restore should be successful)
5) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create IDB backup (backup should be successful) and perform online IDB restore to same CM (Restore should be successful)
6) Enable RBAC and Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create storeones backup (backup should be successful) and perform restore (Restore should be successful)
7) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create IDB backup (backup should be successful), now again revert and reset password and perform online IDB restore to same CM (Restore should be successful)
8) Enable RBAC and enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create IDB backup (backup should be successful) and perform online IDB restore to same CM (Restore should be successful)
9) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create IDB backup (backup should be successful) and perform IDB restore to different CM (Restore should be successful)
10) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create MSSQL backup using single node (backup should be successful) and perform MSSQL restore (Restore should be successful)
11) Enable gMSA, Perform password authentication and create MSSQL backup using cluster node (backup should be successful) and perform MSSQL restore (Restore should be successful)
12) Enable gMSA Perform password authentication and perfrom FileSystem backup in Cluster setup (backup should be successful) and perform restore (Restore should be successful)

common scenario:

1) create 2 users "dp1" and "dp2", perform password authentication in user "dp1" and perform backup. (here user dp1 has access to take backup but not restore) now login to "dp2" perform password authentication in user "dp2" and perform restore for the backup taken by "dp1". Restore should be successful

2) Perform IDB backup (backup should be successful) now enable the feature and perform password authentication and perform IDB restore (restore should be successful)

3)Perform IDB backup (backup should be successful) and enable RBAC and now enable the feature and perform password authentication and perform IDB restore (restore should be successful)

4) Execute operations parallel and check the behaviour:
perform password authentication, Now in GUI perform parallel backup, at the same time in GUI perform restore to some old backup, at the same time from CLI perform list session, and at the same time check liscence. (all the operation should work parallely without any issue)

-----------------

Create a User Scenario:

Steps:

1) Login as an Administrator and launch DP, create users - under admin, I created 2 user 
- GAURAV1 - without password
- GAURAV2 - with password (Data*pr0)

 create users - under user, I created 2 user 
- GAURAVUSER - without password
- GAURAVUSER2 - with password (Data*pr0)

 
2) Create a OS level user 

here without password I cannot create OS user (password is must)
- GAURAV1 - Data*pr0
- GAURAV2 - Data*pr0
- GAURAVUSER - Data*pr0
- GAURAVUSER2 - Data*pr0

3) Now I loggedIn OS using user - GAURAV1 (Data*pr0)
- After login I tried to open DP (But DP could not open, [154:64451] User Authentication failed.) {because in DP during creating user I have not provided password}
- Now I reset the password from CLI. New password "Data*pr1"
omniusers -resetpass -name "gaurav1|anvithdomain|iwf1116209.anvithdomain.local" -pass Data*pr1
- Now I was able to open the DP

- Now from DP GUI for this user GAURAV1 I reset the password to - Data*pr2  (reset password was successful)
- I launched the DP - DP launched successfully with GAURAV1 user
- Now I reset the password from CLI. New password "Data*pr2"
omniusers -resetpass -name "gaurav1|anvithdomain|iwf1116209.anvithdomain.local" -pass Data*pr2
- Now I was able to open the DP

- Now from DP GUI for this user GAURAV1 i cleared the password (password cleared successfully)
- Now I closed DP and tried to launched the DP - (But DP could not open, [154:64451] User Authentication failed.) {Since I have cleared password}


4)Now I loggedIn OS using user - GAURAV2 (Data*pr0)
- After login I tried to open DP - DP launched successfully with GAURAV2 user {because in DP during creating user I have provided password}
- Now I reset the password from CLI. New password "Data*pr1"
omniusers -resetpass -name "gaurav2|anvithdomain|iwf1116209.anvithdomain.local" -pass Data*pr1
- I closed the DP and closed the machine. Now I again loggedIn the OS with user "GAURAV2" and password "Data*pr0" and now I launched DP - DP launched successfully with GAURAV2 user


5) Now I loggedIn OS using user - GAURAVUSER (Data*pr0)
- After login I tried to open DP (But DP could not open, [154:64451] User Authentication failed.) {because in DP during creating user I have not provided password}
- Now I reset the password from CLI. New password "Data*pr1"
omniusers -resetpass -name "gauravuser|anvithdomain|iwf1116209.anvithdomain.local" -pass Data*pr1

- From CLI I reset the password using old password (old password is optional)
omniusers -resetpass -name "gauravuser|anvithdomain|iwf1116209.anvithdomain.local" -pass Data*pr2 -oldpass Data*pr1




==========================================

1) First time when he install DP, this feature is by default enabled, now even administrator cannot reset password
2) If administrator forgets password. How will he reset?
3) CM and Client
